# HMI Portfolio Dashboard

**A curated collection of Human-Machine Interaction (HMI) experiments.**

This directory contains the deployed version of the HMI Laboratory portfolio, featuring a modern dashboard and a series of "legacy" experiments that demonstrate the evolution of web technologies and interaction design concepts.

## 🚀 Features

- **Modern Dashboard**: A responsive summary page (`index.html`) with dark/light mode and tech stack badges.
- **Legacy Experiments**: Preserved original codebases (`HMI-2` to `HMI-6`) showcasing historical web development practices.
- **Guided Tour**: An integrated "Info Overlay" on each experiment page supporting keyboard navigation (`←` Prev, `→` Next).

## 📂 Portfolio Contents

| Experiment | Title | Description | Tech Stack |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **HMI-2** | [Math Sprint Game](HMI-2/index.html) | Gamified math challenge for kids. | HTML5, CSS3, JS |
| **HMI-3** | [Registration Interface](HMI-3/form.html) | Accessible form with validation. | Legacy HTML, JS |
| **HMI-4** | [ATVM Simulator](HMI-4/index.html) | Touch-kiosk logic simulation. | AngularJS, Bootstrap |
| **HMI-6** | [Cloud Services Portal](HMI-6/index.html) | Corporate multi-page website. | Bootstrap 5, PaaS |

## 🛠️ Enhancements & Modernization

While the core experiment code remains **untouched** to preserve its historical context, the following "non-intrusive" enhancements have been injected:

1.  **Info Overlay**: A floating `ℹ️` button on every experiment page provides context without altering the layout.
2.  **View Source**: Direct links to the GitHub source code.
3.  **Keyboard Navigation**: Use **Arrow Keys** to navigate between experiments in sequence.
4.  **Legacy Badges**: Contextual labels on the main dashboard to set viewer expectations.
