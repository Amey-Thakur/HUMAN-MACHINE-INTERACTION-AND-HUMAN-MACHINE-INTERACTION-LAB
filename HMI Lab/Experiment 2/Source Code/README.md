### 📝 Overview

The **Math Sprint Game** is an interactive educational web application designed for children aged 4-7. Its primary objective is to teach basic mathematical concepts through a gamified interface where speed and accuracy are key performance metrics. The user is presented with a series of simple arithmetic equations and must quickly determine their validity (True/False).

### ✨ Features

*   **Gamified Learning**: Engages young students with a "sprint" mechanic, encouraging quick thinking.
*   **Dynamic Equation Generation**: Algorithms ensure a unique set of questions for every session.
*   **Penalty Mechanism**: Accrues time penalties for incorrect answers to reinforce accuracy.
*   **Persistence**: Utilizes Local Storage to track and display "Best Scores" for various difficulty levels (10, 25, 50, or 99 questions).
*   **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various screen sizes including desktops, laptops, and mobile devices.

### 🚀 Usage Guidelines

1.  **Select Difficulty**: Choose the number of questions (10, 25, 50, or 99) from the splash screen.
2.  **Start Round**: Click "Start Round" to begin the countdown.
3.  **Gameplay**: Evaluate the displayed equation. Click **"Right"** if the math is correct, or **"Wrong"** if it is incorrect.
4.  **Completion**: Upon finishing all questions, view your final time (Base Time + Penalties).
5.  **Replay**: Try to beat your best score!
