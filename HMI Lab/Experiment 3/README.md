### 📝 Overview

This experiment focuses on the **Principles of Graphical User Interface (GUI) Design**, specifically regarding data entry forms. The project implements a **Student Registration Form** for a cloud account service. It emphasizes layout structure, data validation, and feedback mechanisms to ensure a smooth and error-free user experience. The design adheres to HCI principles such as visual hierarchy and accessibility.

### ✨ Features

*   **Structured Layout**: Uses a table-based design to align labels and input fields clearly (demonstrating legacy layout techniques often studied in HCI basics).
*   **Comprehensive Data Capture**: Collects name, email, phone, address, demographics, and preferences.
*   **Client-Side Validation**: Includes JavaScript functions to validate:
    *   Mandatory fields (Name, Email, etc.).
    *   Email format (regex/pattern check).
    *   Dropdown selection (Date of Birth).
*   **User Feedback**: Provides immediate alert messages for incorrect or missing data.
*   **Visual Styling**: Styled with CSS for readability, using high-contrast colors for labels and headers.

### 🚀 Usage Guidelines

1.  **Launch**: Open the `Source Code/form.html` file in any modern web browser.
2.  **Fill Data**: Enter sample data into the registration fields.
3.  **Test Validation**:
    *   Try submitting without entering a name or email.
    *   Enter an invalid email format.
    *   Observe the browser alerts that guide you to correct the input.
4.  **Submit**: Fill all details correctly and click "Submit" to see the successful validation flow.
