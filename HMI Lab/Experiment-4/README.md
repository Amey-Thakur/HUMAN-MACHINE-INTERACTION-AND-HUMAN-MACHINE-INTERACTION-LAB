### 📝 Overview

This experiment focuses on determining the basic requirements for an automated system and designing a user-friendly interface. Specifically, it implements an **Automatic Ticket Vending Machine (ATVM)** interface for a metro rail system. The goal is to create an intuitive, touch-friendly UI that allows users to seamlessly book train tickets, select destinations, and visualize their journey details.

### ✨ Features

*   **Interactive Station Map**: Dynamically selectable source and destination stations.
*   **Smart Logic**: Automatically groups stations into main hubs for quicker navigation.
*   **Ticket Visualization**: Real-time preview of the printed ticket as options are selected.
*   **Dynamic Cost Engine**: Calculates fares based on the user's selection and passenger count (Adults/Children).
*   **Bilingual Support**: Displays station names in both English and Devanagari script.
*   **Responsive Design**: Built with Bootstrap and AngularJS for a fluid, application-like experience.

### 🚀 Usage Guidelines

1.  **Select Destination**: Choose a main station hub or a specific sub-station from the list.
2.  **Configure Passengers**: Adjust the number of Adults and Children using the counter controls.
3.  **Journey Type**: Toggle between "Single Journey" and "Return Journey" options.
4.  **Review Ticket**: Verify the details (From, To, Cost, Passengers) on the simulated ticket preview.
5.  **Print**: Click "Print Ticket" to finalize the transaction (simulated with an alert).
