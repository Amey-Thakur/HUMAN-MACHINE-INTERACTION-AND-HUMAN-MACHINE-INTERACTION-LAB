  - At Railway Stations, ATVMs (Automatic Ticket Vending Machines) are used for booking tickets.
  
  - The goal of this project is to create an interface for ATVM machines that allow travellers to purchase tickets at train stations.
  
  - The interface should adhere to basic HCI principles and be easy to use for both regular and occasional travellers.
