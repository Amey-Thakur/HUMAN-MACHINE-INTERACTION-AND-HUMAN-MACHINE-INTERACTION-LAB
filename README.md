     ========================================================================================= -->
## Overview

Human Machine Interaction (CSC801) and Human Machine Interaction Laboratory (CSL801) are core subjects in the Final Year (Semester VIII) of the Computer Engineering curriculum at the University of Mumbai. These courses provide a deep dive into the design, evaluation, and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use and the study of major phenomena surrounding them.

### Course Topics

The curriculum encompasses several key domains in Human Machine Interaction:

- **Foundations of HMI**: History, human capabilities, computer capabilities, and the interaction cycle.
- **HCI Basics**: Paradigms, design rules, and psychological aspects of interaction.
- **Designing the User Interface**: Task analysis, interface styles, and design principles.
- **Interaction Models and Techniques**: Direct manipulation, menu selection, and emerging interaction techniques.
- **Usability Engineering and Evaluation**: Metrics, testing methodologies, and expert reviews.
- **Advanced Interfaces**: Multi-modal interaction, virtual reality, and ubiquitous computing.

### Repository Purpose

This repository represents a curated collection of study materials, reference books, lab experiments, and personal preparation notes compiled during my academic journey. The primary motivation for creating and maintaining this archive is simple yet profound: **to preserve knowledge for continuous learning and future reference.**

As a computer engineer, understanding HMI is crucial for developing intuitive, efficient, and user-centric software systems. This repository serves as my intellectual reference point: a resource I can return to for relearning concepts, reviewing methodologies, and strengthening understanding when needed.

### Why this repository exists:

- **Knowledge Preservation**: To maintain organized access to comprehensive study materials beyond the classroom.
- **Continuous Learning**: To support lifelong learning by enabling easy revisitation of fundamental HMI concepts.
- **Academic Documentation**: To authentically document my learning journey through Human Machine Interaction and Human Machine Interaction Laboratory.
- **Community Contribution**: To share these resources with students and learners who may benefit from them.

All materials in this repository were gathered, organized, and documented by me during my undergraduate studies (2018-2022) as part of my coursework and exam preparation.

### Project Overview

This project involves the development of a sophisticated **Online Chess Game**, engineered as a comprehensive case study in interactive system design and user-centric architecture. The implementation prioritizes fundamental Human-Machine Interaction (HMI) principles, specifically focusing on **direct manipulation** and **immediate visual feedback** to ensure a seamless mental model for the user. 

The system leverages a responsive design framework to maintain interaction consistency across diverse device orientations. At its core, the application integrates complex algorithmic structures for **real-time move validation** and state management, demonstrating the practical application of usability engineering metrics. This project serves as an exploration into the synergy between high-performance back-end logic and intuitive front-end layouts, aiming to optimize the overall **User Experience (UX)** through iterative design and evaluation.

### Acknowledgments

Grateful acknowledgment to **[Mega Satish](https://github.com/msatmod)** for her exceptional contribution to this repository through "Mega's Notes" and "The Wall" - comprehensive module-wise notes that became an invaluable resource for understanding complex HMI concepts. Her constant support, patience, and clarity throughout this journey made a real difference. Learning alongside her was transformative, not only because she explained concepts so clearly, but because she truly cared about understanding them together. Her thoughtful approach to teaching, openness to discussion, and steady encouragement turned challenges into meaningful learning moments. This work reflects the growth that came from learning side by side. Thank you, Mega, for everything you shared and taught along the way.

Special thanks to the faculty members of the Department of Computer Engineering at Terna Engineering College for their guidance and instruction in Human Machine Interaction. Their expertise and support helped develop a strong understanding of user-centric design.

Special thanks to the mentors and peers whose encouragement, discussions, and support contributed meaningfully to this learning experience.
